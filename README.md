# Chess application server

This is the backend code for my chess application, which will be publicly available later on.

It's made with [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com), a Node.js framework I really like a lot.

It's currently a work in progress, therefore not stable.

However, if you want to try it out, please feel free to find out how below.

## Requirements
- Having a recent node.js version installed on your machine.
- Having a recent postgresql version installed on your machine.
- Create a postgresql database, with any name you feel appropriate.
- Rename the `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill the following: PG_HOST, PG_PORT, PG_USER, PG_PASSWORD, PG_DB_NAME.
- Install the dependencies with the package manager of your choice.
- There you go!
